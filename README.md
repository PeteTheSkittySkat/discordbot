# Untitled Discord Bot

UDB is a simple bot for discord, to add Leveling, and some fun commands.

## Starting

Once in the project diretory, you are going to make a config file.

Once you create config.json, you are going to need to add these entries

```json

{
  "token": "DISCORD_TOKEN",
  "dburl": "MONGODB_URL",
  "errorwebhook": "WEBHOOK_URL",
  "openweathermap": "OPENWEATHERMAP_TOKEN",
  "ownerid": "OWNER_ID"
}

```

After you all all of the information needed into config.json, you can run the bot by doing `node index` in the projects directory.
